## What is Toolkit Web?

### Internal Company Platform: Empowering Productivity with Next.js and TypeScript

This web-based platform revolutionizes the company's internal operations, providing a centralized hub for reporting, financial management, and merchant verification. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it ensures a seamless user experience, robust performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Features:

- Streamlined Reporting: Empower departments with intuitive reporting tools, fostering transparency and data-driven decision-making.

- Robust Financial Management: Conduct financial checks with precision and ensure accountability across all transactions.

- Efficient Merchant Verification: Simplify merchant verification processes, minimizing risks and safeguarding business operations.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Enjoy seamless integration with macOS and Linux environments, ensuring accessibility for all team members.
  Intuitive User Interface: Navigate the platform effortlessly with a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

## Getting Started
- Clone the project
  ```
  git clone <url>
  ```
- Install the dependencies
  ```
  npm i
  ```
- Configure db with prisma
  ```
  npx prisma db push
  ```

### Notes
When making changes to the db models we need to reflect these changes on the database.  
On production we can do that by:
```
npx prisma db push
```
On development we can do the same thing or do it the safer way by droping the db and pushing the changes again.
```
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma db push
```
(Don't forget to go to the db client on your machine and delete the generated tables)
